# pythonCameraTracker
Python script used to capture motion and track time in frame.

This script will capture motion on a camera using openCV and plot the time intervals associated with that motion using Bokeh.
This can be used in conjunction with Raspberry Pi and a usb web cam for a more portable setup.
